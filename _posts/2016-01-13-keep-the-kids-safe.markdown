"The 13-year-old boy was showing off his father's pistol to a companion. He pulled back the slide, he later told investigators. The gun went off.

Shortly after, 10-year-old Michael Tunnell was dead." (Omaha World-Herald, July 30, 2009)

While I agree wholeheartedly that children should know to not handle firearms unsupervised (and some would say, never at all), I believe strongly that all children should be taught how to handle firearms safely. Children pick up a lot of false information from movies and television about the proper handling of firearms. They need to be taught how to safely hold a gun without killing themselves or anyone else.

The frustrating thing about gun accidents is that most of them can be avoided by knowing and practicing the following three simple safety rules.

# Three rules for safely handling a gun

## Rule 1: NEVER point a gun at anything you don't want dead.

There are no exceptions to this rule and there is no excuse for failing to teach it to your children. In the above story, both the 13-year-old and the 10-year-old should have been taught that a gun is not a toy and that a gun should never be pointed at anything you don't want dead. (This includes looking down the barrel or pointing it at a friend and pretending to shoot them.)

Had the gun not been pointed in poor Michael's direction, the accidental discharge of the firearm would have been nothing more than a scary story and perhaps a spanking for the 13-year-old (proper method of punishment being a separate discussion).

## Rule 2: ALWAYS assume the gun is loaded. 

There are also NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. It does not matter if you have just verified the gun was not loaded, you must still assume that it is. There have been numerous gun accidents involving automatics with a single bullet in the chamber. In the story above, for example, the 13-year-old would have been much more careful with the gun, had he assumed that it was loaded.

## Rule 3: ALWAYS verify the gun is not loaded. 

After you verify the gun is not loaded, you must still assume that it is loaded. This may seem contrary to logic, but the negative effects of making a mistake are so great that even if you have verified that the gun is not loaded, you must still avoid pointing it at anything unless you want that thing dead and you must still assume that it is loaded.

## Bonus Rule: Teach everyone that a gun without a clip can still have a bullet in the chamber.

If you were following all the rules above, this wouldn't make much difference, since you wouldn't be pointing the gun at anyone, and assumed it was loaded.  However, you should know that some unloaded weapons can still fire a bullet that is in the chamber, even if the clip has been removed.
